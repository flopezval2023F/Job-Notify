# Job Listing Tracker

A personal job search assistant that notifies you when new job postings appear that match your criteria. This tool automates the job hunting process by checking job listings via the [JSearch API (RapidAPI)](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/jsearch) and sending alerts (via email) when relevant opportunities are posted. Currently setup for entry level positions.

---

## What It Does

* Searches job listings for roles that match your **titles**, **locations**, and **experience level**
* Filters out previously seen jobs so youâ€™re only notified about new listings
* Sends email alerts with direct application links
* Can run:

  * Locally using `python run.py`
  * Or autonomously via **AWS Lambda + EventBridge**
